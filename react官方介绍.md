# [React](https://reactjs.org/)

React is a Java Script library for building user interfaces.

  * **Declarative:** React makes it painless to create interactive Uls.
  
  Design simple views for each state in your application,and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable,simpler to understand, and easier to debug.

  * **Component-Based:** Build encapsulated components that manage their state, then compose them to make complex Uls. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app keep the state out of the DOM.

  * **Learn Once, Write Anywhere:** We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewrithing existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).

  # Installation

  React has been designed for gradual gradual adoption from the start, and **you can use as little or as much React as you need:**

  * Use [Online playgrounds](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html#online-playgrounds) to get a taste of React.

  * [Add React to a Website](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html) as a `<script>` tag in one minute.

  * [Create a New React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) if you're looking for a powerful JavaScript toolchain.

  You can use React as a `<script>` tag from a [CDN](https://reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html), or as a `react` package on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react).
